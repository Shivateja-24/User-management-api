- Retrieve users by ID, phone number, manager, or active status
- Bulk update or individually update users
- Smart update: updates create new rows if only manager is changed
- Modular validation using reusable utility functions
- Postman documentation included

## ðŸ§± Tech Stack

- Node.js
- Express
- SQLite (via sqlite3)
- UUID for unique user IDs
- Postman (for API testing/documentation)

## ðŸ“Œ API Endpoints

### ðŸ”¸ Create User

Creates a new user. Validates mobile number, PAN number, and checks for existing active manager

### ðŸ”¸ Get User

Fetches users. You can pass filters like user_id, mob_num, manager_id, or is_active.
If no filters are passed, it returns all users.

### ðŸ”¸ Delete User

Delete a user based on user_id or mob_num

### ðŸ”¸ Update User

Updates user(s).  
If only manager_id is given, it creates a new row (soft update).
If multiple fields are passed, updates the existing row directly.
